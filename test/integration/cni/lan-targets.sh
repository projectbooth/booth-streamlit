# lan-targets.env answer on LAN_PORT, so egress.sh can tell a NetworkPolicy drop from an address
# nobody answers. A TCP listener on the kind network's gateway (the host's bridge address), and a DNAT
# for each address, for packets arriving from the kind bridge only (the host's own traffic, e.g. to the
# runner's real metadata service, is untouched). Pod traffic leaves the node SNATed (Calico's
# natOutgoing), reaches the host by the node's default route, and is DNATed to the listener; Calico's
# policy sees the original destination, before any of this.
